# Hang-man - JavaFX Implementation

This project is a JavaFX implementation of the classic Hangman game, developed as part of University project. The game allows users to guess letters to uncover a hidden word, with a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Users can input their guesses, and the game will check the validity of the input, update the game state, and visually draw parts of the hangman figure for incorrect guesses.
- **Visual Effects:** The game uses fade animations for a smooth and engaging user experience.
- **Game Reset:** Users can reset the game and play again or exit the application.
- **Word Management:** The game reads words from a dictionary file to use as the hidden word for each session.
